# Download your CV via Google Docs API

This is a vite project that complements the video tutorial on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RafeeJ).

You can watch this video [here: https://youtu.be/Ux1BiA6ZWbI](https://youtu.be/Ux1BiA6ZWbI)

## Prerequisites
You need a Google Drive API key, and the Document ID of the Google doc that you would like to be downloaded. Store this in the env file. Usually, you would not upload your `.env` to GitHub, however I have done in this case to show what it should look like!

## How to run
Install using `npm install` and then start the server with `npm run dev`.
